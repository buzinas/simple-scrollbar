# SimpleScrollbar
Very simple vanilla javascript library for creating a custom scrollbar cross-browser and cross-devices.

## Demo

 - [Original demo by buzinas](http://buzinas.github.io/simple-scrollbar)
 - [This forks demo](http://graydixon.github.io/simple-scrollbar)

## Benefits

- Extremely lightweight (less than 1KB after gzip and minify)
- It uses the native scroll events, so:
  - All the events work and are smooth (mouse wheel, space, page down, page up, arrows etc).
  - The performance is awesome!
- No dependencies, completely vanilla Javascript!

## This Fork

- Added alternative methods for adding / removing classes (using el.className instead of el.classList when .classList is absent) negating the need for the polyfill mentioned below.

## Browser Support

It was developed for evergreen browsers, but it works on <del> both IE10 and IE11 either </del> IE9 upwards.

<del>If you want to make it works down to IE9, the only thing you need to do is to add the [classList polyfill] (https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js).</del>

```HTML
<!--[if IE 9]><script src="classList.min.js"></script><![endif]-->
```

## Usage
### Auto-binding
Include the attribute `ss-container` in any `<div>` that you want to make scrollable, and the library will turn it for you

```HTML
<div ss-container>One</div>
<div ss-container>
  <span>Two</span>
</div>
```

### Manual binding
If you want to manually turn your div in a SimpleScrollbar, you can use the `SimpleScrollbar.initEl` method.

```HTML
<div class="myClass"></div>

<script>
  var el = document.querySelector('.myClass');
  SimpleScrollbar.initEl(el);
</script>
```

### Dynamically added content
If you use some client Framework, like AngularJS, Aurelia, CalangoJS, etc - or any library that includes DOMElements dynamically in your app, and you want to use the SimpleScrollbar `ss-container` attribute, you can use the `SimpleScrollbar.initAll` method, and it will turn all the elements with that attribute in a scrollable one for you.

```Javascript
var div = document.createElement('div');
div.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', '<span>One</span>');
div.setAttribute('ss-container', true);

var otherDiv = div.cloneNode(true);
otherDiv.querySelector('span').textContent = 'Two';

document.body.appendChild(div);
document.body.appendChild(otherDiv);

SimpleScrollbar.initAll();
```
